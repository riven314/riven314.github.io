# [Paper Review] Netizen-Style Commenting on Fashion Photos: Dataset abd Diversity Measures

Creating a human-like image caption with machine is a hard but attractive problem.This paper offers a new angle to approach the problem. The approach is driven by a critical drawback the authors observe about the conventional approach of automatic image captioning:  
```
modern methods only focus on optimizing metrics used in machine translation, 
which causes absence of diversity â€” producing conservative sentences. 
These sentences can achieve good scores in machine translation metrics but are short of humanity.
```

A good human-like caption is the one that is engaging, relevant and attractive. Conventional approach optimizes a model to output a caption of high factual precision for an image. Usually such captions do not sound like human because they solely focus on factual description. A good caption could be lack of factual description because an image could manifest itself. A good caption comes into many form: it could be a complement of an image, capturing what is missing in an image; it could also be an emotional expression with respect to the image, sharing what the audience feels about the image. With such rich set of dynamics about a good caption, a good image captioning model should take into account the diversity of its output.
