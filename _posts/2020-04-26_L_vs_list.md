# [fastai2 Series] 10 Comparisons Between ```L``` and ```list```

#### ![credit](/images/2020-04-26-L_vs_list/L.png)

```list``` can be so expressive thanks to features like list comprehension, but sometimes it could be hard to read when compounded with multiple operations in one line. Also it may not be expressive enough for some complex operations. ```L``` comes to rescue.

As a second post about fastai2, I would talk about ```L```, one of the foundational base classes heavily used in fastai2. We will highlight 10 features of ```L``` with simple examples, and compare it against its equivalent operations in ```list```. 

### 0. Prerequisites

```L``` is packaged in fastcore, a standalone library with all the base classes heavily used in fastai2 (e.g. ```Transform```, ```ItemTransform``` ... etc). It is a super light and you can easily install it by ```pip install fastcore```.

Alternatively, you can install the whole fastai2 [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2), but it would be an overkill simply for running through this post.

```python
from fastcore.foundation import L
```

### 1. What is ```L```?

So what is ```L```? Similar to ```list```, it is just a container for different objects. You can think of it as a better version of ```list```, with extended functionalities. Those functionalities make ```L``` more handy to use especially in data science tasks.

You can define a ```L``` object by a list or its elements. When you display (manifested by ```self.__str__``` or ```self.__repr___```) the object, it will show you both the number of elements and its elements:

```python
x = L([1, 3, 4, 5])
y = L(1, 3, 4, 5)
x, y
```




    ((#4) [1,3,4,5], (#4) [1,3,4,5])



In terms of display, there is another difference between ```L``` and ```list```. For ```L``` it shows elements horizontally with limit (i.e. first 10 elements if more than 10 entries) while for ```list``` it displays all elements.

```python
x = L([i for i in range(20)])
y = [i for i in range(20)]
x, y
```




    ((#20) [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...],
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19])



### 2. ```L``` v.s. ```list```

How much better is ```L``` compared against ```list```? It is the best to illustrate that with simple examples. 

#### 2.1. Splitting list of tuple by ```L.itemgot```
With ```L.itemgot```, you can easily convert a list tuple into separate lists in one line of code. If you are using list, you have to firstly separate the list by ```zip``` and then converting each output into ```list```. (originally ```tuple```)

```python
x_l = L([(1, 'apple'), (2, 'orange'), (3, 'banana')])
x_list = [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'orange'), (3, 'banana')]
x, x_list
```




    ((#3) [(1, 'apple'),(2, 'orange'),(3, 'banana')],
     [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'orange'), (3, 'banana')])



```python
a, b = x_l.itemgot(0), x_l.itemgot(1)
a, b
```




    ((#3) [1,2,3], (#3) ['apple','orange','banana'])



```python
a, b = zip(*x_list)
a, b = list(a), list(b)
a, b
```




    ([1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'])



Additionally, if the elements are class objects/ dictionaries, you can specify the attributes/ keys using string in ```itemgot```.

```python
x_l = L([{'num': i} for i in range(3)])
x_list = [{'num': i} for i in range(3)]
x_l, x_list
```




    ((#3) [{'num': 0},{'num': 1},{'num': 2}], [{'num': 0}, {'num': 1}, {'num': 2}])



```python
x_l.itemgot('num'), [i['num'] for i in x_list]
```




    ((#3) [0,1,2], [0, 1, 2])



#### 2.2. Combing lists by ```L.zipwith```
This is the reverse operation of 2.1. In ```L```, concatenating multiple lists into a list of tuple is as easy as calling ```zipwith```. In ```list```, you can implement the same by list comprehension.

```python
a_l, b_l = L(1, 2, 3), L('apple', 'orange', 'banana')
a_l.zipwith(b_l)
```




    (#3) [(1, 'apple'),(2, 'orange'),(3, 'banana')]



```python
a_list, b_list = [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
[(a, b) for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list)]
```




    [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'orange'), (3, 'banana')]



#### 2.3. Searching indexes by ```L.argwhere```
```L.argwhere``` works like ```np.argwhere```. It outputs the index (indexes) of elements that satisfies your specified criteria. You specify your criteria as a function in the argument ```f```. For ```list```, you can implement the equivalence in list comprehension.

```python
x_l = L([1, 1, 2, 3, 4])
x_list  = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
x, x_list
```




    ((#3) [(1, 'apple'),(2, 'orange'),(3, 'banana')], [1, 1, 2, 3, 4])



```python
x_l.argwhere(f = lambda i: i > 1)
```




    (#3) [2,3,4]



```python
[i for i in x_list if i > 1]
```




    [2, 3, 4]



#### 2.4. Multiple Indexing by ```L.__getitem__```
There are many ways you can do indexing (i.e. ```__getitem__```) in ```L```. You can index one element by ```int``` and you can also index multiple elements by ```list``` or ```L```. On the contrary, ```list``` does not naturally support indexing of multiple elements.

```python
x_l = L(['apple', 'orange', 'banana'])
x_l[0, 0, 1], x_l[L(0, 0, 1)]
```




    ((#3) ['apple','apple','orange'], (#3) ['apple','apple','orange'])



```python
x_list = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
[x_list[i] for i in [0, 0, 1]]
```




    ['apple', 'apple', 'orange']



#### 2.5. Apply a function element-wise by ```L.map``` and ```L.filter```|
```L.map``` and ```L.filter``` work similarity to Python prebuilt ```map``` and ```filter```. It applies a function ```f``` on each of its elements and return a new copy. One difference is that ```map``` and ```filter``` returns a generator instead of a new copy.

```python
x_l = L(1, 2, 3)
x_l.map(f = lambda i: i**2)
```




    (#3) [1,4,9]



```python
x_l.filter(f = lambda i: i >= 2)
```




    (#2) [2,3]



```python
x_list = [1, 2, 3]
o = map(lambda i: i**2, x_list)
o, [i for i in o]
```




    (<map at 0x15395c95bf50>, [1, 4, 9])



```python
o = filter(lambda i: i >= 2, x_list)
o, [i for i in o]
```




    (<filter at 0x15395c95b450>, [2, 3])



#### 2.6. Create Expressive Key-value Pairs by ```L.map_dict```
```L.map_dict``` is slightly complicated than the above methods. It essentially returns a ```dict```. Its keys are the original elements. You specify a function ```f``` to apply on each elements and return as the value of each key. The function ```f``` can have multiple arguments. You can specify the additional arguments of ```f``` as keyword arguments in ```L.map_dict```.

```python
def name_file_by_idx(i, prefix = None, ext = 'png'):
    if prefix is not None:
        out = f'{prefix}_{i:04}'
    else:
        out = f'{i:04}'
    return f'{out}.{ext}'
```

```python
x_l = L([i for i in range(4)])
x_l.map_dict(f = name_file_by_idx, prefix = 'class1', ext = 'png')
```




    {0: 'class1_0000.png',
     1: 'class1_0001.png',
     2: 'class1_0002.png',
     3: 'class1_0003.png'}



```python
x_list = [i for i in range(4)]
{k: name_file_by_idx(k, prefix = 'class1', ext = 'png') for k in x_list}
```




    {0: 'class1_0000.png',
     1: 'class1_0001.png',
     2: 'class1_0002.png',
     3: 'class1_0003.png'}



#### 2.7. Chaining Multiple Operations
For the methods I highlighted above, so long as they return another copy of ```L```, you can keep applying another operation right after that. The principle is pretty similar to ```pandas```. As a result, you can chain multiple operations together in just one line of code. I personally find such sequential presentation more readable and intuitive.

```python
x_l = L((0, 'xyz'), (1, 'xyz'), (2, 'xyz'))
x_l.itemgot(0).filter(lambda i: i >= 1).map(lambda i: f'class1_{i:04}.png')
```




    (#2) ['class1_0001.png','class1_0002.png']



```python
x_ls = [(0, 'xyz'), (1, 'xyz'), (2, 'xyz')]
[f'class1_{i[0]:04}.png' for i in x_ls if i[0] >= 1]
```




    ['class1_0001.png', 'class1_0002.png']



#### 2.8. Getting Distinct Elements by ```L.unique```

You can easily get distinct elements by ```L.unique``` with order respected. For ```list```, you can do the same by firstly converting it to ```set``` and then back to ```list```, but the drawback is that the output does not respect order, as shown.

```python
x_l = L(2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4)
x_l.unique()
```




    (#4) [2,1,4,3]



```python
x_list = [2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4]
list(set(x_list))
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



#### 2.9. Shuffling by ```L.shuffle```
Shuffling is commonly used in data partition. ```L.shuffle``` can achieve that by returning a new copy of shuffled list. For ```list```, you need help from ```random.shuffle``` to do that. Note that ```random.shuffle``` makes change in-place.

```python
x_l = L([i for i in range(5)])
x_l.shuffle()
```




    (#5) [0,3,1,2,4]



```python
import random

x_list = [i for i in range(5)]
random.shuffle(x_list)
x_list
```




    [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]



#### 2.10. Adding None
Adding ```None``` to ```list``` will return ```TypeError```, so you need to write an additional condition to handle that. But for ```L```, you won't get any error by adding None.

```python
L(1, 2) + None
```




    (#2) [1,2]



```python
try:
    [1, 2] + None
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
```

    can only concatenate list (not "NoneType") to list


### 3. Closing Remarks

Due to limited length of this post, we can't exhaust all the functionalities of ```L``` here, but its design is actually pretty simple. You can refer to [its source code](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore/blob/master/fastcore/foundation.py#L310) to learn more about its functionality!
